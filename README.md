# NLDD: Measuring Chain-of-Thought Faithfulness

Preprint under review

Code for computing Normalized Logit Difference Decay (NLDD) and related analyses.

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation for measuring whether Chain-of-Thought reasoning steps causally influence model predictions.

## Metrics Computed

- NLDD (faithfulness)
- RSA (representational similarity)
- TAS (trajectory alignment)
- Linear probing accuracy
- Reasoning horizon detection

## Tasks

- Dyck-n (syntactic)
- PrOntoQA (logical)
- GSM8K (arithmetic)
